Free Geek Vancouver's hardware testing scripts.

This is the set of scripts we use for poking and prodding various
hardware.  It also includes our drive wiping scripts in particular.
We use it by having a read-only NFS share setup which machines are PXE
booted into and the testmenu gets ran automatically.
